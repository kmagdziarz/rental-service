# Car rental service

## The problem
We are going to implement a car rental service.
The service will have a list of cars and will be able to rent them to customers.
The service will also be able to return the cars and to list the cars that are currently rented.
The service will be able to list all the cars and to list the cars that are available for rent.
The service will be able to list the cars that are rented by a specific customer.

## Technical details
It's a maven based project, so it should be easy to import it in your favourite IDE. There are some Junit 5 test cases. They can be executed from the IDE or from the command line by running:

    mvn test

We use LTS Java version 17 and Java 17 is the baseline here. Feel free to use any Java version (17 or above) which works for you. You can change the java version in the pom.xml file by editing following line:

    <java.version>17</java.version>


## Tasks
There are 3 tasks. They depend on each other so start with [Task 1](#task-1) then continue with [Task 2](#task-2).

### Task 1


### Task 2

### Task 3
